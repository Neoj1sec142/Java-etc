# Basic Operations in Java: Section 4    
- Back to the basics of math in grade school...   
- consider the expression 5 + 3 = 8    
- '5' and '3' are the operands   
- + is the operator   
* Operators help express equasions in math and code   
***   
### Java Operators:   
* Arithmetic Operators   
* Relational Operators   
* Logical Operators   
* Assignment Operators   
* Increment and Decrement Operators   
* Bitwise Operators   
***   
### Arithmetic Operators:   
- is a mathematical function that takes two operands and performs a calculation on 
        them
* + addition: adds values on either sides of the operator   
* - subtraction: subtracts right operand from left operand   
* * muliplication: multiplies values on either sides of the operator   
* / division: divides left hand operand by the right hand operand
* % modulus: divides left operand by right operand and return the remainder
