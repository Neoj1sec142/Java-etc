## Storage Containers:
* Variables are a named location where some data can be stored. This means that when 
        you creat a var you reserve some space in the memory
* a variable is a container in our memory that is used to store the data, where the 
        data is its value(entity) and the nae given the the var is a label
- Variable = Vary + Able : Something that can vary
## Creating Variables in Java:
* Specify the data type to define tht type of data that need to be stored
* Declare a label to the memory location
* Assign the value using = (optional) 
* add the value (optional)
#### SYNTAX ####
data_type var_name; OR data_type var_name = value;

#### A Few Key Programming Terms:
* Identifier - a name assigned to an element in a program (Var Name)
* Literals - source code representation of a fixed value. (Values)
* Keywords - predefined, reserved words that have special meaning to the compiler
        they are part of the syntax and they cannot be used as an Identifier
