# Iteration in Java:
#### Two types of Iteration:
* definite iteration - in which the num of repetitions is specified explicitly in 
    advance. (run 3 laps of this code...etc)
* indefinite iteration - in which the code will execute until some condition is met 
    (run until user completes form... etc)

#### Different Loops in Java:
* For loop 
* While Loop
* Do While loop
