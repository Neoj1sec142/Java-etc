// 1st CHUNK     (public class Display)
// "public" key word means this code is public and can be accessed anywhere
// "class" is a container thay holds some data and helps group code
// every file must have one class in it as the definition
// "Display" name given to class (good practice to keep caps)

// 2nd CHUNK     (public static void main(String[] args))
// this defines the main method of the app
// every app in Java must contian the main method. 
// basically the entry point from which the code starts

// every statement in java is terminated with a ;
// printIn() = Java || print() = python
