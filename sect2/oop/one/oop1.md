# Intro to OOP in Java Pt1:
* in programming there are different paradigms or patterns that define 
    how to write and structure our code. Each paradigm has different functionalitiies and behaviors
#### Some Paradigm Patterns:
* Structural programming
* Procedural programming
* OOP
* Functional programming
* etc
***   
* oop is a programming paradigm that provides a means for structuring 
    programs so that properties and behaviors are bundled into individual objects
* it is not possible to write a java program without a class. 
* oop in java is a programming approach that focuses on using objects and 
    classes as the building blocks of the program
* the major focus of oop is reusability
#### Pillars of OOP:
* Abstraction
* Encapsulation
* Inheritance
* Polymorhpism

Abstraction - means abstracting only the details/data which migh concern 
    the user
Encapsulation - similarly in encapsulation we try to encapsulate all the 
    data as a single entity
Inheritance - in programming, one element can inherit various 
    characteristics and capabilities from another element. Inheritance is important because it supports the conecpt of reusability
PolyMorphism - poly = many morphism = forms in programming data comes in 
    many forms via array string int obj ...

### Classes and Objects:
* just like a variable is used to store some data, similarly, a clas is a 
    high-level container that is used to store data, define behaviors(methods), and group various programming statements
* therefore, a class is used to encapsulate the whole surface code into a 
    single wrapper that can be accessed with help of objects

##### What is a Class?
- a class is a user-defined prototype for an object that defines the set 
    of attributes that characterize and object of the class
- in simple words it is a blueprint for new objects created in that class 
    to define how they will be contructed and what variables and behaviors they will have access too
***   
##### What is an Object?
- an object is known as an instance of the class. as we have seen, a 
    class is just a blyeprint so its just like a description
- Objects have 2 things: 
    * Attributes (data variables of the class)
    * Behaviors (methods defined in the class)
