# Intro to OOP in Java Pt1:
* in programming there are different paradigms or patterns that define 
    how to write and structure our code. Each paradigm has different functionalitiies and behaviors
#### Some Paradigm Patterns:
* Structural programming
* Procedural programming
* OOP
* Functional programming
* etc
***   
* oop is a programming paradigm that provides a means for structuring 
    programs so that properties and behaviors are bundled into individual objects
* it is not possible to write a java program without a class. 
* oop in java is a programming approach that focuses on using objects and 
    classes as the building blocks of the program
* the major focus of oop is reusability
#### Pillars of OOP:
* Abstraction
* Encapsulation
* Inheritance
* Polymorhpism

Abstraction - means abstracting only the details/data which migh concern 
    the user
Encapsulation - similarly in encapsulation we try to encapsulate all the 
    data as a single entity
Inheritance - in programming, one element can inherit various 
    characteristics and capabilities from another element. Inheritance is important because it supports the conecpt of reusability
PolyMorphism - poly = many morphism = forms in programming data comes in 
    many forms via array string int obj ...
