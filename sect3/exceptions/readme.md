# Exceptions:
- any error the user can see is basically a bad user experience, and might even stop the application.
- Errors are the mistakes or faults in the program that cause it to behave unexpectedly
- Programming errors are generally known as bugs and the process to remove bugs from the program is called debugging.
- In general, there are three tyoes in which errors are categorized:
    * Syntax errors - is an error in the 
        source code of a program 
    * Logic errors - logic errors will cause your program to perform in undesired operations that you didn't intend your program to perform. = IMPROPER LOGIC 
    * Runtime errors - errors not in syntax or logic so not caught by complier but when u look at the program u notice a bug. they are generated when the program is running and lead to abnormal behavior or termination of the program. The general cause of runtime errors is because your program is trying tp perform an oipoeration that is not possible to carry out.
