# File Handling:   
- There are instances where we need to syrpe and retrieve data from somewhere else, rather than the variables or avilable data structures. In such case, files play an impotant role
***   
* Files are names locations on a disk to styore relate dinforamtion. They are used to permanently store data in a non-volatile memory such as hard disks and more.
* These files can be any type via .txt .csv etc
* One can just flush the data in the carious files such as above according to the requirment and retrve it whenever needed.
* Files are stored in hard drives whereas, variables and other structures store data in Random Access Memory (RAM) which is volatile and loses its data when the computer is turned off or the program is terminated
* Files help us to store data permanently and retireve them since they are stored in ROM (Read-Only Mode)
#### Three steps of working with Files:
* Opening the File
* Performing Actions (Reading or Writing)
* Closing a File
