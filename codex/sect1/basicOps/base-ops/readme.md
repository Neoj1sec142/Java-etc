# Basic Operations in Java: Section 4    
- Back to the basics of math in grade school...   
- consider the expression 5 + 3 = 8    
- '5' and '3' are the operands   
- + is the operator   
* Operators help express equasions in math and code   
***   
### Java Operators:   
* Arithmetic Operators   
* Relational Operators   
* Logical Operators   
* Assignment Operators   
* Increment and Decrement Operators   
* Bitwise Operators   
***   
### Arithmetic Operators:   
- is a mathematical function that takes two operands and performs a calculation on 
        them
* + addition: adds values on either sides of the operator   
* - subtraction: subtracts right operand from left operand   
* * muliplication: multiplies values on either sides of the operator   
* / division: divides left hand operand by the right hand operand
* % modulus: divides left operand by right operand and return the remainder

### Comparing Stuff:
##### Comparison Operators:
* > Greater Than
<!-- * < Less Than -->
* == Equal too
* != Not equal too
* >= Greater than or equal too
<!-- * <= Less than or equal too -->

### Logical Operators in Java:
- is a symbol or word used to connect two or more expressions such that the value of
         the compound expression produced depends only on that of the originial expression and on the meaning of the operator
* && (Logical AND) - returns tru if both the operands are true
* || (Logical OR) - returns true if either of operands are true
* ! (Logical NOT) - reutnr true if the operand is false(compliments the operand)

### Shortcuts for operators:
* += - adds the right operand to the left nad assigns results to left operand
* -= - subtracts the right from the left and stores the res in the left
* *= - multiplies the right with the left and res to the left
* /= - divides the left by the right and stores the res in the left
* %= - divides left by right and returns the remainder to the left

### Increment and decrement:
* ++ = add one
* -- = minus one
- the both have two names prefix and postfix
* Prefix: the increment and decrement unary operators appear before the operand, 
        while using the prefix form we first update the value of the operand, and then we use the new value in te expression
        EX ++num
* Postfix: the operators appear after the operand. While using the postfix form we    
        first use the value of the the operand in the expression an then update it.
        EX num++
